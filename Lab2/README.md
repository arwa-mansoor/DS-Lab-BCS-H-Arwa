# Lab 02 Tasks

---

## Task 1:

**Implement a program that dynamically allocates a 1D array of integers.**
- **The size should be given by the user.**
- **Initialize all elements with zero.**
- **Then, let the user update values at different positions.**
- **Finally, print the array and deallocate memory properly.**

## Task 2:

**Write a program that uses a dynamic 2D array to represent a seating chart in a classroom.**
- **Rows represent benches, columns represent seats on each bench.**
- **Initialize the array with 0 (empty).**
- **Let the user fill seats (1 for occupied).**
- **Print the final seating chart in matrix form.**

## Task 3:

**Design a program to handle marks of students in different courses using a jagged array (since each student is enrolled in a different number of courses).**
- **Input the number of courses each student takes.**
- **Dynamically allocate memory for each student accordingly.**
- **Calculate and display each studentâ€™s average marks.**

## Task 4:

**Create a dynamic program that manages monthly expenses for a family.**
- **Use a 1D dynamic array to store expenses for n months.**
- **Add a feature to resize the array if the user wants to track more months later.**
- **Compute and display the total and average expenses.**

## Task 5:

**Write a C++ program that dynamically creates a 2D matrix and provides:**
- **Addition of two matrices.**
- **Subtraction of two matrices.**
- **Ensure safe memory handling with proper allocation/deallocation.**

## Task 6:

**Implement a Safe Pointer class to wrap around an integer pointer.**
- **Provide methods for setValue(), getValue(), and release().**
- **Demonstrate the class by storing marks of 5 students and printing them safely without direct pointer manipulation.**

## Task 7:

**A company has multiple departments, each department has a different number of employees.**
- **Use a jagged array where each row corresponds to a department and columns store employee salaries.**
- **Calculate:**
  - **The highest salary in each department.**
  - **The department with the overall maximum average salary.**

---

## Task 8:

**Create a dynamic program to store temperature readings of a city for n days and m different times in a day using a 2D array.**
- **Calculate the daily average temperature.**
- **Find the hottest and coldest day.**

---

## Task 9:

**Implement a program to represent a sparse matrix using a dynamic 2D array.**
- **Input matrix elements.**
- **Display the matrix in normal form.**
- **Display the matrix in compressed form (row, column, value).**

---

## Task 10:

**Design a program that maintains library book records using dynamic arrays.**
- **Each row represents a category (e.g., Fiction, Science, History).**
- **Each category has a different number of books (use a jagged array).**
- **Store book IDs dynamically and allow the user to search for a given book ID.**
- **Print whether the book is available and in which category.**
